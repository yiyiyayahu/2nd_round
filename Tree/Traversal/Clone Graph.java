/*
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/

这道题其实就是用BFS或者DFS traverse整个graph
我开始没太想清楚，主要这个node和node之间我要连接起来对吧，不然我怎么构成一个图
和那个copy list有点像，就是node和cloned是一一对应的对吧
然后有些点可能以前traverse过了，就要提取出来，不要再新建了，所以用一个hashmap来存原来的node和对应的clonedNode
